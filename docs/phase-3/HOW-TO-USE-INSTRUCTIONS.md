# How to Use Phase 3 Instructions

**Welcome to Phase 3!** This guide explains how to use the step-by-step instructions.

---

## 📥 First: Download the Instruction Files

**Download these 3 files to your project:**

1. **PHASE-3-MASTER-GUIDE.md** → Save to `docs/phase-3/`
2. **step-3.1-webhook-setup.md** → Save to `docs/phase-3/`
3. **QUICK-REFERENCE.md** → Save to project root (for easy access)

---

## 🗂️ File Organization

**Put the files here in your project:**

```
vehicle-parts-chatbot-main/
├── QUICK-REFERENCE.md           ← Keep this at root for quick access
├── docs/
│   └── phase-3/                 ← Create this folder
│       ├── PHASE-3-MASTER-GUIDE.md
│       └── step-3.1-webhook-setup.md
└── webhook-server/              ← You'll create this in Step 3.1
```

## 🎯 Two Ways to Follow Instructions

### **Method 1: Read from Project Files** (Recommended)

**Best for:** Following along at your own pace

1. **Open VS Code** in your project
2. **Open file:** `docs/phase-3/step-3.1-webhook-setup.md`
3. **Split screen:** Code on left, instructions on right
4. **Copy/paste** code from instructions
5. **Test** after each section
6. **Come back to chat** when ready for next step

**Pros:**
- ✅ Can see instructions and code side-by-side
- ✅ Easy to copy/paste
- ✅ Can reference anytime
- ✅ Works offline

---

### **Method 2: Chat-Based Guidance**

**Best for:** Real-time help and debugging

1. **In chat, say:** "Start Step 3.1" or "Next step"
2. **I'll guide you** through each command
3. **Copy/paste** commands I give
4. **Share results** if something doesn't work
5. **I'll debug** with you in real-time

**Pros:**
- ✅ Real-time help
- ✅ Immediate debugging
- ✅ Can ask questions anytime
- ✅ More interactive

## 📋 Recommended Workflow

**Combine both methods for best results:**

### **Step 1: Read Ahead**
```
Open: docs/phase-3/step-3.1-webhook-setup.md
Action: Read through completely first
Time: 5 minutes
```

### **Step 2: Work Through It**
```
Follow: Instructions in the file
Copy: Code examples
Test: After each section
Time: 45 minutes
```

### **Step 3: Verify Completion**
```
Check: Completion checklist at end
Test: All tests pass
Come to chat: Say "Done with Step 3.1"
Time: 10 minutes
```

### **Step 4: Move to Next**
```
In chat: Say "Next step"
I'll confirm: Everything looks good
Open next: step-3.2-railway-deploy.md
Repeat: Steps 1-3
```
