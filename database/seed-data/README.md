supabase db execute -f 001_discount_grades.sql
supabase db execute -f 002_customers_sample.sql
supabase db execute -f 003_products_sample.sql
supabase db execute -f 004_workshops_sample.sql
supabase db execute -f 006_auto_responses.sql
supabase db execute -f 005_sample_orders.sql
```

## ‚úÖ Verification

After running all seed files, verify the data:

### Check Record Counts
```sql
SELECT 
    'discount_grades' as table_name, COUNT(*) as records FROM discount_grades
UNION ALL
SELECT 'customers', COUNT(*) FROM customers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'products', COUNT(*) FROM products
UNION ALL
SELECT 'workshops', COUNT(*) FROM workshops
UNION ALL
SELECT 'auto_responses', COUNT(*) FROM auto_responses
UNION ALL
SELECT 'orders', COUNT(*) FROM orders;
```

**Expected Results:**
```
discount_grades:  5
customers:       50
products:        30
workshops:       40
auto_responses:  20
orders:          20
```

### Test Customer Recognition
```sql
-- Find customer by phone
SELECT customer_code, name, customer_grade, phone
FROM customers 
WHERE phone = '+9779841234567';
```

### Test Product Search
```sql
-- Find Toyota Corolla parts
SELECT product_code, name, category, unit_price
FROM products 
WHERE vehicle_make = 'Toyota' 
  AND vehicle_model = 'Corolla';
```

### Test Discount Calculation
```sql
-- Calculate discounted prices for LEO customers
SELECT 
    p.name,
    p.unit_price as original_price,
    dg.discount_percentage,
    ROUND((p.unit_price * (1 - dg.discount_percentage/100))::numeric, 2) as discounted_price
FROM products p
CROSS JOIN discount_grades dg
WHERE dg.grade_code = 'LEO'
LIMIT 10;
```

### Test Workshop Finder
```sql
-- Find workshops in Kathmandu
SELECT name, address, segment, monthly_servicing
FROM workshops 
WHERE city = 'Kathmandu'
ORDER BY name;
```

## üîÑ Resetting Data

To clear all seed data and start fresh:

```sql
-- ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This deletes ALL data!
DELETE FROM order_items;
DELETE FROM orders;
DELETE FROM auto_responses;
DELETE FROM workshops;
DELETE FROM products;
DELETE FROM customers;
DELETE FROM discount_grades;

-- Now re-run seed files
```

## üìù Important Notes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è This is TEST Data!

- **NOT for production use**
- Sample data for development only
- Phone numbers are fictional
- Order data is completely made up

### üîÑ Replace with Real Data

Before going to production, replace with:

1. **Full Customer Data**
   - Source: `customers_cleaned_for_supabase.csv`
   - Records: 958 customers
   - Use CSV-to-SQL converter script

2. **Full Product Data**
   - Source: `LTVS_Items_For_SupabaseSheet1 2.csv`
   - Records: 231 products
   - Contains all actual inventory

3. **Full Workshop Data**
   - Source: `workshops_cleaned_for_supabase.csv`
   - Records: 1,225 workshops
   - All partner locations

### üì± Phone Number Format

All customer phone numbers use format: `+977XXXXXXXXXX`
- Example: `+9779841234567`
- Required for WhatsApp integration
- Update with real test numbers for testing

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

Use this seed data to test:

### 1. Customer Recognition
```
Customer: "Hi, my code is C001"
Expected: Recognize "Kathmandu Auto Parts", LEO grade, 40% discount
```

### 2. Product Search
```
Customer: "I need brake pads for Toyota Corolla"
Expected: Show BRK-TOY-COR-001 with discounted price
```

### 3. Order Placement
```
Customer: "I want to order 5 units of BRK-TOY-COR-001"
Expected: Calculate total with customer's discount
```

### 4. Workshop Finder
```
Customer: "Find workshops near Kathmandu"
Expected: Return list of Kathmandu workshops with details
```

### 5. Multi-lingual Responses
```
Customer: "‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞" (Nepali greeting)
Expected: Respond in Nepali from auto_responses
```

## üéØ Next Steps

After seeding data:

1. ‚úÖ **Test Database Queries**
   - Run verification queries above
   - Ensure data is correct

2. ‚úÖ **Test API Endpoints**
   - Customer recognition endpoint
   - Product search endpoint
   - Order creation endpoint
   - Workshop finder endpoint

3. ‚úÖ **Configure Botpress**
   - Set up customer flow
   - Test with sample phone numbers
   - Verify discount calculations

4. ‚úÖ **Performance Testing**
   - Test query speeds with indexes
   - Monitor response times
   - Optimize slow queries

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Foreign key violation"
**Solution:** Make sure you run files in correct order. Orders MUST be last!

### Issue: "Duplicate key error"
**Solution:** Clear existing data first:
```sql
DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_code LIKE 'C0%';
```

### Issue: "Column does not exist"
**Solution:** Verify your database schema matches `schema-actual.sql`

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution:** Check Row Level Security policies are configured correctly
